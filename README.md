# Boston Housing Market Analysis

This project focuses on a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the application of various machine learning models to the Boston Housing Dataset. Our primary goal is to identify the most effective algorithm for predicting housing prices based on a multitude of factors presented within the dataset.

## Analysis Overview

The Boston Housing Dataset, a renowned dataset in machine learning circles, offers a rich ground for analysis with its detailed attributes related to the housing market. This project employs a meticulous EDA process, laying the groundwork for subsequent modeling efforts. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover underlying patterns and insights that can inform our model selection and optimization strategies.

## Model Evaluation Metrics

To gauge the performance of each machine learning model, we relied on several key statistical measures, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation framework:

- **Average Squared Error (ASE):** Measures the average of the squares of the errors between observed and predicted values, providing insight into model accuracy.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Offers a more penalty-driven perspective on model accuracy by emphasizing larger errors.
- **Mean Squared Prediction Error (MSPE):** Focuses on the prediction capabilities of the model, highlighting how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
